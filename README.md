## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Files Manager is a robust solution for managing files in a scalable and efficient way. The project is built using Node.js and Express, and it integrates MongoDB for data storage and Bull for managing background jobs. The application supports user authentication, file uploads, thumbnail generation, and background email sending. It is designed to be easily deployable and scalable, making it a great fit for both small and large projects.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
